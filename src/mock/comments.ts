Add 1\n\n    After you have circled the earth, place a sheet of paper on a pile, and start walking again.\n\n    Continue, until the paper pile reaches the sun, then place a grain of sand in the Grand Canyon and start over.\n\n    Continue until you have filled the Grand Canyon, etc etc\n</code></pre>\nIt continued for a lot of such steps until you finally counted up to the number in question.<p>What was the number? What were the steps?",

That would handle the arrows and clicking or grabbing the scroll box.<p>But the wheel would be tricky because you want to scroll by only one or a few items, not items&#x2F;10k. With a static viewport-sized DIV set to overflow-y:scroll and large vertical content size, positioned so you don&#x27;t see the scroll bar, when the mouse is over it it should capture wheel movement which you could translate to an offset from your macro scroll position.<p>Just a thought.

I think SMT solvers should be clever enough to be able to work the search around some ciphers.<p>Maybe an SMT solver is a rather heavy-weight approach, but I think it fits the task of searching through 2^122 values :)<p>Edit: even with no cipher, it takes said approach ~1.6s to find that after 0x1067D3DC2F4951AEA8DB8D0108D7D65 the first occurrence of 0xABCD is at 0x1067D3DC2F4951AEA8DB8D0108DABCD with Z3 (cvc5 and Bitwuzla are slightly slower), which is perhaps a bit too slow.. perhaps it could be improved to something more reasonable by restricting the search to near the end until that fails, and reducing the matchable positions based on the dashes, but that&#x27;s back to effort.<p>Edit 2: slightly more effort later:<p><pre><code>    cipher:   0x15FD586DF0CE258730098B94325ACE7 * (val ^ 0x93C324915DB2B3C4D4CD8135C0DDF1)\n    inverse: (0x1D52334877384DE3A6DAA4A3312A6D7 * val) ^ 0x93C324915DB2B3C4D4CD8135C0DDF1\n\n    example first 10 entries:\n      0: 2839676B79617D5B9FDF9D43CFB3077\n      1: 123C0EFD889357D46FD611AF9D58390\n      2: 143418475AFDC869FFF2B46C3468A45\n      3: 3E36BFD96A2FA2E2CFE928D8020DD5E\n      4: 002EC9233C9A13786005CB94991E413\n      5: 2A3170B54BCBEDF12FFC400066C372C\n      6: 2C2979FF1E365E86C018E2BCFDD3DE1\n      7: 162C21912D6838FF900F5728CB790FA\n      8: 18242ADAFFD2A995202BF9E562897AF\n      9: 0226D26D0F04840DF0226E51302EAC8\n\n    binary search max set to `10 * 2**search_bit_width` after after the chosen start\n    trying to find a match only in the last 3 possible places (i.e. searching WXYZ only matches *****WXYZ, ****WXYZ*, ***WXYZ**)\n    searching for 0xFF00FFCC after index 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAA:\n      nearest match found at: 0xAAAAAAAD04E3DA\n      ciphered: 0x0E9399CC39B716BC96348AFF00FFCCD\n      time taken: 0.7s (bitwuzla or cvc5), or 1s (z3)\n</code></pre>\nBut alas I&#x27;m stupid, and searching doesn&#x27;t care about lexicographic ordering, and you necessarily have to search all possible places, not just the end, and that&#x27;s a ton slower.

The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all &quot;unauthorized&quot; use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was &quot;fraud and phishing&quot; going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA&#x2F;cease-and-desist.

I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to &quot;serverHold&quot; on iwantmyname&#x27;s domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I&#x27;m assuming no one on their end &quot;closed&quot; the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get in touch with them via their abuse and support emails, but no response likely due to the time of day, so I decided to &quot;escalate&quot; the issue myself on social media.',

So Funko sells merchandise related to the Jurassic World franchise.[1] But, according to Licensing International, Mattel licenses the toy rights to that franchise from Universal Products and Experiences, the merchandise arm of Universal Pictures. [2] Also, Funko sells Disney Princess dolls.[3] Mattel announced a multi-year licensing deal with Disney to license the doll rights for Disney Princess dolls. “The courage and compassion found throughout our Disney Princess and Frozen stories and characters continue to inspire fans around the globe,” said Stephanie Young, President of Disney Consumer Products, Games and Publishing. “By furthering our longstanding relationship with Mattel, we look forward to expanding the worlds of Disney Princess and Frozen, introducing an innovative new era of these beloved franchises through captivating products and play opportunities.”<p>Might be useful to send letters to Disney&#x27;s and Mattel&#x27;s legal departments. Mattel paid a lot of money for that Disney license. Disney is very protective of those licenses. Mattel lost the Disney license to Hasbro for a few years due to overproduction of low quality dolls. I&#x27;m surprised to see Funko selling low-quality Disney dolls.

Our world is now filled with quasi-scientific cults. From flat earthers to anti-vaxxers, to people focused on &quot;healing crystals&quot;, to the resurgence of astrology.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be saying this about anyone in a more shall we say &quot;classical&quot; domain.

Or is this just how technology breakthroughs start (after all the Transformer paper wasn&#x27;t)<p>But no matter what I just can&#x27;t help but feel like the author&#x27;s choices harm the credibility of the work.

It&#x27;s just so strange.<p>I can imagine now some of the conversations that might have happened at Google when they choose to keep a lot of innovations related to genAI under the wraps (I&#x27;m being charitable here of their motives), and I can&#x27;t help but agree.<p>And I can&#x27;t help but be saddened about OpenAI&#x27;s decisions to unload a lot of this before recognizing the results of unleashing this to humanity, because I&#x27;m almost certain it&#x27;ll be used more for bad things than good things, I&#x27;m certain its application on bad things will secure more eyeballs than on good things.",

I have yet to see a single announcement or new development that we learn about through email.  In most cases we learn these things when they get covered by some online outfit, posted on HN, etc.<p>OpenAI isn&#x27;t the only company that seems to act in this manner.  I find this to be interesting.  Your paying customers actively want to know about what you are doing and, more than likely, would love to get a heads-up before the word goes out to the world.  Hearing about things from third parties can make you feel like a company takes your business for grant it or does not deem it important enough to feed you news when it happens.<p>Another example of this is Kickstarter, although, their problem is different.  I have only ever backed technology projects on KS.  That&#x27;s all I am interested in.  And yet, every single email they send is full of projects that don&#x27;t even begin to approach my profile (built over dozens of backed projects).  As a result of this, KS emails have become spam to be deleted without even reading them.  This also means I have not backed projects I would have seriously considered and I don&#x27;t frequent the site as much as I used to.<p>Getting back on topic: It will be interesting to see how Sora usage evolves.",

Check out the detail on the lion, for example!\n- The landscapes and aerial shots are absolutely incredible. \n- Quality is much better than Mochi &amp; LTX out of the box. Mochi&#x2F;LTX seem to require specifically optimized workflows (I&#x27;ve seen great img2vid LTX results on Reddit that start with Flux image generations, for example). Hunyuan seems comparable to Sora!<p>Cons:<p>- Still nearly impossible to access Sora despite the “launch”. My generations today were in the 2000s, implying that it’s only open to a very small number of people. There’s no api yet, so it’s not an option for developers.\n- Sora struggles with physical interactions. Watch the dancers moonwalk, or the ball goes through the dog. HunyuanVideo seems to be a bit better in this regard. \n- Can&#x27;t run it locally mode (obviously)\n- I haven&#x27;t tested this, but I think it&#x27;s safe to assume Sora will be censored extensively. HunyuanVideo is surprisingly open (I&#x27;ve seen NSFW generations!)\n- I’m getting weird camera angles from Sora, but that could likely be solved with better prompting.<p>Overall, I’d say it’s the best model I&#x27;ve played with, though I haven’t spent much time on other non-open-source ones. Hunyuan gives it a run for its money, though!',

The result of this calculation has no practical use. \n&gt; \n&gt; They use this particular problem because it has been formally proven (with some technical caveats) that the calculation is difficult to do on a conventional computer (because it uses a lot of entanglement). That also allows them to say things like &quot;this would have taken a septillion years on a conventional computer&quot; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#x27;s exactly the same calculation that they did in 2019 on  a ca 50 qubit chip. In case you didn&#x27;t follow that, Google&#x27;s 2019 quantum supremacy claim was questioned by IBM pretty much as soon as the claim was made and a few years later a group said they did it on a conventional computer in a similar time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;skdh&#x2F;status&#x2F;1866352680899104960" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;skdh&#x2F;status&#x2F;1866352680899104960</a>',

I appreciate the idea that some low level tools, properly tuned, will be maximally useful. There was a lottt of overhead playing with those vector dbs, and often in testing I would just want to throw up like 10,000 embeddings and do some things with them; I didn&#x27;t want to have to choose a pytorch variant in a docker image to do so.<p>Anyway.

Many people had contributed their efforts to the Redis project for free - both in terms of code but also in advocacy, writing tutorials, publishing example code etc - and when they did that it was under the understanding that project would remain under the same open source license. It honestly felt like a betrayal of trust.<p>2. From a purely selfish point of view, my favourite thing about open source licenses is that they let me know exactly what I&#x27;m allowed to do and build on that software without having to consult a license. Licenses like the new Redis one leave me potentially needing to get my own legal advice depending on what I&#x27;m building on the software. I don&#x27;t want to spend my time, energy or money on that stuff!<p>I do also see these kinds of license trends as harmful to open source generally. It used to be that you could pick an open source project and build a business on it and expect that the project would stay available to you under those well understood terms. That&#x27;s not the case any more - not just because of Redis, there are a number of other high-profile license rug-pulling projects. I&#x27;m sad about that.<p>(And yes, I do understand and dislike the trend of businesses building on open source without contributing back. There are no clearly correct answers here.)",

Valkey is largely sponsored by AWS and other big tech companies so they can have community maintained storage because they cannot use Redis anymore.

It’s very interesting for me to see how people at different stages of their career think of these things.<p>I think this licensing fracture that’s happening across the industry is unfortunate, there’s a been a lot of broken trust. The SSPL is on the face of it more reasonable than the BSL. It clearly states that it only becomes viral when “offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program”. So it seems it should be pretty safe to use Redis as a cache or session store within a larger system. Contrast with hashicorp, which forbids use in any product they consider a competitor. But I also empathize with people who are scared of using <i>any</i> license that’s untested in court.<p>Tangential: I love Inconsolata as a terminal font (and I appreciate the “hacker” aesthetic of a monospaced blog) but perhaps consider using a body font for your longer articles. Although I’m sure most of your readers know how to change the font if they want to, one of the great things about plain HTML :)",

If your reaction to this is &quot;that&#x27;s fine, the community can take over from here.&quot; Then that is literally the exact option on the table today. From the very moment that Redis Labs was made non-viable by AWS under their original license, the fork was right there for the open source community to take over.

    text: "When someone puts a significant and useful software under an open license (like BSD) and nurtures a vibrant open-source community around it, sure, everyone else can definitely take it and use it for free. But nobody serious will use it just because it is free. They will consider other intangible but critical aspects like risks to themselves w.r.t future viability of the project, ability to get custom work done to it or around it, keeping up with hardware and software ecosystem trends etc. These things have second order implications – how healthy the broader developer ecosystem is, is there a broad base of core committers we can hire, how easy it is to upstream our changes, who else is using it at similar scale, criticality, cost efficiency; is commercial support available (sometimes 3rd party commercial business support ecosystem is essential due to regulatory&#x2F;compliance reasons), do hardware vendors actively participate in the open-source community and ensure it runs well on their hardware etc.<p>Apart from free users, even the contributors have very similar considerations for their participation.<p>But the starting point is the license – it has to be a clear and unambiguous open-source license that is widely well-understood – especially w.r.t the blast-radius or infection radius of the license. Does it infect the library code that is linked&#x2F;loaded into it? Does it infect the independent binary&#x2F;processes that scaffold around it (say, control-plane, orchestrator, proxy etc)? What are the obligations if it does?\nIf we have to get lawyers involved to answer these questions because it is a custom license that is vaguely written or it has never been challenged in a court or the license holder is of unknown reputation, these are huge red flags.<p>Another equally important consideration is the motivations of the stewards of the project. While this isn&#x27;t explicitly stated, one cannot be naive about it. Contributors and users will have to consider a gamut of scenarios – best&#x2F;base&#x2F;worst scenarios and make their judgement. With smaller steward organizations, there are one kind of risks while with larger organizations open-sourcing there are other kinds of risks. If they are competitors in some way that&#x27;s another challenge. If there is no natural alignment of use-cases functionally or non-functionally, that&#x27;s another issue etc.<p>With recent changes in Redis, all these things have become less clear and straightforward.",

I have since started collaborating with Valkey.  But as antirez pointed out how it would go, it&#x27;s because of technical grounds, not because of license angst.

Beam Piper&#x27;s _Little Fuzzy_, &amp;c.), I decided I wanted to read biographies to them, in chronological order, starting in as far back in history as was possible --- that was a surprisingly difficult list to put together (arguably because I missed texts such as: _Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology: The Lives and Achievements of 1195 Great Scientists from Ancient Times to the Present Chronologically Arranged_), so we did a dry run of just American Presidents --- this worked quite well, and I found it expedient to read an &quot;adult&quot; biography to pair with a children&#x27;s one so as to anticipate and answer questions which came up during the reading.

    text: "This is amazing to see! I&#x27;ve wanted a good, digital, historical atlas for more than 10 years. The ones I&#x27;ve seen have all had some kind of limitation that&#x27;s made them less-than-ideal imo. This one seems to check most of my boxes in terms of features &amp; UX, plus it looks really nice! Big kudos to everyone involved. I will definitely be using this a lot!<p>That said, seeing it IS a definitely bittersweet since I started my own version of this about a year ago (after giving up on something nice like this ever showing up). Being a hobby project it&#x27;s far from being able to match the progress that this has made. Now I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still worth to pursue, which is both sad but also nice since I can do other things and take pleasure in using this without having to worry about actually making it myself...<p>Some features that I had (or was planning to have) that I think would be very nice, for inspiration; in case you&#x27;re interested:<p>- Allowing anyone to add and edit data. One of mny gripes with many of the existing digital atlases was that they were very bare bones in terms of how much content they had. I hoped for a &quot;Wikipedia for historical maps&quot; kind of place. Maybe not at all what you envision and maybe your setup is too complex to allow for it, but I wanted to mention it at least. But at least your feedback system was very nicely integrated and easy to use, so hopefully that&#x27;ll be good enough (and spare you the pain of having to care about trolls and layman mistakes).<p>- Showing hierarchical Regions instead of just 1. For instance, being able to show the Holy Roman Empire above its various duchies&#x2F;principalities etc, and those above their various counties etc. It feels overly simplistic to ONLY show topmost Region. And quite often there&#x27;s not even any single Region that&#x27;s undebatably the &quot;topmost&quot; either.<p>- Generic &quot;Events&quot; for things that aren&#x27;t battles.<p>- Events or something similar to explain what&#x27;s going on whenever a Region&#x27;s border changes, a Region appears&#x2F;disappears, a Region changes name etc. Basically connect the change you see on the map with a link to learn more about what caused that change. I think this is super valuable when it comes to going from &quot;cool, that country grew a lot there&quot; to &quot;so what actually happened?&quot;.<p>- The search field seems to be connected to modern-day places rather than historical Regions. For instance, I expected being able to search for &quot;Kalmar Union&quot; to get to the place and time of the Kalmar Union. Or to search for &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; and go to his time and place. But kudos for supporting native spellings of place names, like &quot;København&quot; for Copenhagen.<p>- I see that some battles have a corresponding war underneath their names, which is really nice. I would love to be able to filter&#x2F;find&#x2F;highlight all battles from a given war. That way it would be a LOT easier to get a better grasp of the extent of a given war. I&#x27;d also like to see the war&#x27;s duration and its belligerents.<p>Then some UX feedback and bugs I noticed:<p>- Showing the modern-day names of cities before they exist feels pretty weird. It can help for users to navigate and understand where they are, but I think it would be very nice to at least have an option to turn them off. Ideally also to have them show up only after they&#x27;ve actually been founded. A bonus would be to also show them with their historically accurate name.<p>- I notice that you see the name of the Region currently in the center of the screen, but I think it&#x27;d be more useful to show what&#x27;s at the cursor&#x27;s position. Especially when you have a bunch of small Regions. If you tied it to the cursor you could also highlight the currently selected Region.<p>- The red box for the current year looks reeeeally draggable to me. I would combine it with the slider.<p>- Having keyboard commands for going forward&#x2F;backward with the time slider would be really nice, to complement when you&#x27;re panning around with the mouse.<p>- I totally understand where you&#x27;re going with showing BC years as &quot;-X&quot;, but it looks pretty weird. Especially when it&#x27;s outside the time slider, like underneath the names of people.<p>- Also, there&#x27;s no &quot;year 0&quot;; it goes directly from 1 BC to AD 1.<p>- When there are multiple overlapping things (e.g. all the battles in Italy during the 80s BC) it feels a bit random which gets shown. It&#x27;s also not clear that there are stuff that gets hidden until you zoom close enough.<p>- If I open a wiki page for a battle and then click a link in the article, I&#x27;m then unable to return to the original wiki page. Clicking on the battle again does nothing. I have to either close the wiki sidebar or click on another battle first.<p>- There&#x27;s no way to close the Maps sidebar except by opening the wiki sidebar?<p>- Closing the top panel (the one with Regions, Rulers, People, Battles) causes the Maps sidebar to pop out. Feels weird; I was expecting the top panel to get minimzed similar to how the wiki and Maps sidebars are in their inactive states.<p>Sorry for the length of this post, but I just had a decade of thoughts to get off my chest; not to mention a year of spare time work on doing almost exactly what you have here. Whether you take any of my feedback or not, thank you so much for making this!",

Poland reappears after WW1<p>6. Poland gets eaten by Germany and Russia again in WW2<p>7. Poland shifts back west by Stalin and his mass population transfer program.

It might be a state with a central government as we think of them now, or it might be a collection of states or proto-states that are conventionally grouped by common features of their cultures, or it might just be an area where the pottery is consistently similar.<p>2. More importantly I think the areas _outside_ the shading can be misleading, too: it makes the world look empty, even though most  of the world (but not all! especially in the places settled by the Polynesians much later) definitely had people in it by the time this timeline starts.",
